## How do I...

### Get help or ask a question?

Ask anything in our [Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/NAb6H3UTjK) â€” weâ€™re friendly and happy to help. [Our core contributors](https://github.com/bluewave-labs/checkmate?tab=readme-ov-file#-contributing) are active and ready to support you. You can also use [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/bluewave-labs/Checkmate/discussions) section to ask your questions.

### Report a bug?

1. Search [existing issues](https://github.com/bluewave-labs/checkmate/issues).
2. If itâ€™s not listed, open a **new issue**.
3. Include as much detail as possible: what happened, what you expected, and steps to reproduce. Logs and screenshots help.

### Suggest a new feature?

1. Open a new issue with the **feature request** template.
2. Share your use case and why it would help.
3. You can discuss it in [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/NAb6H3UTjK) before you code.

### Set up Checkmate locally?

Frontend & backend:
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

By default, the frontend expects the backend on `http://localhost:3001`. Update configs if needed.

### Start contributing code?

1. Pick or open an issue (check `good-first-issue`s first)
2. (optional but highly suggested) Read a detailed structure of [Checkmate](https://deepwiki.com/bluewave-labs/Checkmate) if you would like to deep dive into the architecture.
3. Ask to be assigned. If there is alrady someone assigned and it's been more than 7 days, you can raise the flag and ask to be assigned as well.
4. Create a branch from `develop`.
5. Write your code.
6. Run and test locally.
7. Open a PR to `develop`.

Start with [good first issues](https://github.com/bluewave-labs/checkmate/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22).

### Improve the documentation?

Docs live in [checkmate-documentation](https://github.com/bluewave-labs/checkmate-documentation). You can fix typos, add guides, or explain features better.

### Help with translations?

We use [PoEditor](https://poeditor.com) for translations. You can:
- [Sign up and join your language team](https://poeditor.com/join/project/lRUoGZFCsJ).
- Translate UI strings.
- Ask questions on Discord in the relevant #translations channel.

Make sure all new UI strings in code use `t('key')`.

### Submit a pull request?

Follow the [pull request checklist](#pull-request-checklist). Your PR should:
- Be focused on one issue.
- Be tested locally.
- Use our linting and translation rules.
- Include the related issue (e.g. `Fixes #123`).
- Be opened against the `develop` branch.

---

## Code guidelines

- Use ESLint and Prettier (`npm run lint`).
- Follow naming conventions: `camelCase` for variables, `PascalCase` for components, `UPPER_CASE` for constants.
- No hard-coded strings â€” use `t('your.key')` for everything visible.
- Use the shared theme and components. No magic numbers or hardcoded styles.
- Follow structure and patterns already used in the codebase.

---

## Pull request checklist

Before submitting your pull request, please confirm the following:

- **You have tested the app locally and confirmed your changes work.**
- You reviewed your code and removed debug logs or leftover code.
- The GitHub issue is assigned to you.
- You included the related issue number in the PR description (e.g. `Fixes #123`).
- All user-facing text uses the translation function `t('key')`; no hardcoded strings.
- You avoided hardcoded URLs, config values, or sensitive data.
- You used the shared theme for any styling â€” no magic numbers or inline styles.
- The pull request addresses only one issue or topic.
- You added screenshots or a video for any UI-related changes.
- Your code passes linting and has no TypeScript errors.

If one or more of these are missing, we may ask you to update your pull request before we can merge it.

## Branching model


- Code contributions should go to the `develop` branch.
- `master` is used for stable releases.
- Use descriptive branch names, like `fix/login-error` or `feat/add-alerts`.
- Make sure that you are using the latest version.
- Make sure you run the code locally. The Checkmate [documentation](https://docs.checkmate.so) covers it.
- Find out if the functionality is already covered, maybe by an individual configuration.
- Perform a [search](/issues) to see if the enhancement has already been suggested. If it has, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.
- Find out whether your idea fits with the scope and aims of the project. It's up to you to make a strong case to convince the project's developers of the merits of this feature. Keep in mind that we want features that will be useful to the majority of our users and not just a small subset. If you're just targeting a minority of users, consider writing an add-on/plugin library.
